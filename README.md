# linked-list

This is my implementation of the linked list for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists).

A linked list is a data structure that consists of connected nodes. There's a head node that points to the next node and so forth.

Part of implementing a linked list was creating various methods to append nodes, find nodes, etc.
